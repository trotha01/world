World
===
World is a game used for learning or practicing different languages. The game is
initiated with a specified language, say 'Spanish'. Then as the player goes
around the world, everything seen and heard is in Spanish. This is based off the
idea that the best way to learn or practice a language is to immerse yourself by
going someplace that actually going to a country or region that uses that
language. Since plane tickets and hotel costs are expensive, I figured a free
use game would be a nice alternative.

When you see kids growing up, learning a language, they constantly make many
pronunciation and grammer mistakes. So speak along with the game, mimicking what
you hear. If your not pronouncing it correctly, that's okay, you're learning.
The correct pronunciation will come as you hear different voices at different
speeds saying the same thing throughout the game.

This game is meant to be well-documented, making it easy for developers to
expand the game as they wish. It is also meant to be 'simple' to add a new
language. Or at least as simple as adding a new language can be.

Note: This is still very much in development.
